Changes:
- Added basic fan control (On/Off only so far)
- Added door servo control
- Added RGB indicator LED control
- Removed MAX6675 support because I have no way to regression test, it conflicted with new features, and it's no longer being sold.
- Updated display info for 16x2
- Tons of under-the-hood stuff

Known Issues:
- RGB LED color is wrong
- Fan may cool too quickly right after reflow
- Preheat PID sometimes never crosses 150 C if ambient temp is too cold.

To-Do:
- Add PID/PWM control to fan
- Make RGB LED behave correctly per stage/state
- Add more beeper/buzzer control
- Add selector for Pb/Sn and Pb-free reflow modes
- Tune the PIDs so they work regardless of oven/ambient idiosyncrasies.

- Initial fork
- Deleted all the schematic files because this version isn't compatible with the RocketScream hardware. (Sorry RocketScream! Your shield and sketch rock, but I wanted some different features.)
